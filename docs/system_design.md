# 🧠 System Design Document

## 📌 Project Name
**AI Data Scientist Agent** — A modular, agent-based application that assists analysts in exploring, validating, and understanding datasets through an intelligent, conversational interface.

---

## 📐 System Architecture Overview

### Architecture Type:
> Micro-modular monolith with agent-based orchestration and user-in-the-loop control.

### High-Level Components:
1. **Frontend UI**: Chat interface + thought process notebook (Copilot-style)
2. **Backend API**: Orchestrates agents and responds to user prompts
3. **Agent Modules**: Individual processing units (Data Agent, EDA Agent, Feature Agent)
4. **Storage**: Workspace folder for raw data, cleaned data, plots, and logs
5. **LLM/NLP Layer** *(optional)*: Used for prompt interpretation or natural language summarization

## 🧱 Components & Responsibilities

### 1. `frontend/`
> Streamlit or React-based UI for user input, results, and conversational interaction.

- Prompt box for user queries
- Side notebook to display agent reasoning/logs
- Plots and summaries rendered as visual evidence

### 2. `backend/`
> FastAPI-based backend responsible for routing, validation, and data management.

- Routes incoming prompt to orchestrator
- Interfaces with agents and returns responses
- Saves uploaded files or DB results to `/workspace`

### 3. `agents/`
> Each agent is a self-contained module with clear input/output definitions.

| Agent              | Responsibility                                                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Agent**     | Handles file uploads and database connections                   |
| **EDA Agent**      | Performs data profiling, null analysis, correlations, and charts |
| **Feature Agent**  | Ranks features based on relevance, quality, and interpretability |
| **Modeling Agent** *(future)* | Trains simple models with explainability             |
| **Insight Agent**  | Converts analysis into natural language summaries               |

### 4. `notebook/`
> Markdown-based thought logs generated by agents to track decision-making transparently.

### 5. `workspace/`
> Stores uploaded data, intermediate files, plots, and final outputs.

## 🔁 Request Flow

```plaintext
User Prompt → Backend (FastAPI)
          → Controller parses intent
              → Data Agent pulls or loads data
              → EDA Agent performs profiling
              → Notebook logs written
              → User confirms/refines
              → Feature Agent ranks features
              → Optional: Modeling Agent
          → All outputs returned to UI
